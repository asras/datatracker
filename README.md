# DataTracker
A simple class for making data provenance easier to manage.

The DataTracker stores files in a folder with a name either given by a random UUID or a user-specificed name.

The purpose of the DataTracker is to generate IDs for a given data run and store relevant files so one can see exactly what code produced the data.
